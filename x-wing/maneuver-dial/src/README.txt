Here are some files. Be aware that the arm and insert are somewhat subject to the calibration of the printer, which is to say that these are perfect for *my* printer...

The two "tool" files are forms used to help in sanding the other parts. You don't *have* to have them, but if you're going to try to clean up the parts, they are helpful.

The arm piece needs to have the top edges (ones at the end of the post) shaved down with an x-acto, most likely. If you don't do that, and you force it into the dial, then you're somewhat likely to have the post break off if/when you try to remove the arm. There's no good way to fix the dial at that point.

You may need to sand down the end of the post in order to get the right amount of friction against the dial (i.e., so that it doesn't spin accidentally). I do that with sandpaper, but it could be done with an emory board or whatever. Doesn't take a whole lot. Could also just put tape on the inside of the plastic shell, I guess.
