These files are simply a processing of Geordan Rosario's x-wing miniatures
font into STL and OpenSCAD forms for use in building various 3D models.

This is a reminder of how I got the font installed:

   git clone https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font.git
   cd xwing-miniatures-font/dist/
   cp *.ttf ~/Library/Fonts/
 
Using this to get OpenSCAD from paths:
