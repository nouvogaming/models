G1 X180 Y163 F1800 ; roughly center of bed (for the probe) -- this is a point in the grid, accounting for probe offset
G1 Z10 F300                    ; position over bed
M190 S70                       ; heat to 70 degrees, wait to complete

M561                           ; clear any bed transform
G29 S2                         ; clear current bed map (does it matter?)
G30                            ; probe bed to establish Z=0

G29                            ; probe the bed and enable compensation

M140 S0                        ; stop heating
G1 Z15 F300                    ; just get the extruder sort of out of the way
