# Summary

This is a deflector attachment for the Titan Aero to reduce the amount of cooling on the build plate from the powerful heatsink fan.

I have included 2 versions - one that has a wire guide slot and one that does not.

I printed this in PLA and haven't had any issues as a result.  This was designed around the use of the Titan Aero on a Prusa i3 Mk2, but could be used for other 3d printers.

Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, or questions.

# Print Settings

Notes: 
I printed with 4-6 outer layers so that it wouldn't do any infill.
