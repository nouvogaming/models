# Summary

*UPDATE* I have updated most of the files for a better match and almost no sanding. I also added some pieces to get the kit more accurate. The Gripalt file close the gap between the grip and the magwell, but you ll need to get rid of the small ridges on the nerf rail.
For my builds I prefer to use this canon instead of mine :https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2349155
I have also added various remix parts :
Remix of Side_Rail_B from the blasterforge Hulker kit https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493540
Remix of Top_rail and Handle from the blasterforge Blasterdizer kit https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1841154
Remix (mirror and resized version) of the flying skull by Peachpunk https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:432974
All parts were printed at .2 with 3 shells and 20-30%infill.
