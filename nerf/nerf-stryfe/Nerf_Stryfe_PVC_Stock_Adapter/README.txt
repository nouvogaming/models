# Summary

I wanted an adapter for the Stryfe that allowed me to use some PVC pipe for the bulk of the stock.  I wanted to match the lines of the Stryfe body as much as possible (the left side wall would have been way too thin, so I built it up a little).  Having two pieces to the collar allows for a redesign of just that side.

I don't plan on removing the stock, let alone during games, so semi-permanently clamping it with the screws was favorable to some spring-loaded design.  Once screwed together, it's very solid and it's not going anywhere.

Edit: I added a simple butt end.  I found that an 8" piece of PVC was perfect for me, but I'm also pretty tall.  My 7yo liked it much smaller at 4".  I also built up the left side of the main adapter a bit more, opened up the screw holes a little (no drilling necessary), and chamfered some of the edges.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: FlashForge
Printer: Creator Pro
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
The pieces should sit flush against each other, though my pictures show a gap due to the raft and brim lifting during my print.  I have very conservative speeds and my print took about 3.5 hours for the blaster side, printed simultaneously, and 5 for the shoulder side.

I printed with two perimeters and three top/bottom layers.  I would probably bump up perimeters to three or four, in the future.

# Post-Printing

## Clean-up

The holes and recessed areas for the screws were very snug and required a hex wrench to get them through, initially.   I drilled them out a little for ease of use.

I found the PVC was very, very snug and it's unlikely that I'll bother to cement the stock adapter cap to it.

## Hardware

(4) M3-0.50x20 mm socket head screws and matching nuts for adapter
(2) M3-0.50x20 mm socket head screws and matching nuts for butt pad 
(1) length of 1" PVC for the stock itself (OD 1.315 in / 33.40 mm)
