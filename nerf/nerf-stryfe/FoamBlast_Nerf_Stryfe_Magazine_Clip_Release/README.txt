# Summary

Finally a mag release that is comfortable without being extended to an obscene degree.  If you’re like us and hit the mag release with your rev finger, you’re tired of the mag releases either tearing up your knuckle, or being so long you knock them accidentally.  Ours is extremely smooth and printed at high resolution in a very bright and almost perfect match to the Blaze Orange Hasbro uses.  This is wider than the popular Worker release and without all the ridges.  It compliments our Bobololo style rev triggers with a similar curve.  

Please check out our shop at http://foamblastshop.com if you would like to buy this pre-printed, or for various other items.
