# Summary

I created this after printing a couple of different designs from here and finding them either too small, uncomfortable, or poorly fitting. This is the initial version, and still being revised.

UPDATE 1: First print had tolerance issues with the fit. Revised model uploaded already, and print is under way. 

UPDATE 2: Second print completed, and it fits. Still off slightly in a couple of spots, with slight sanding needed on the bottom of the side plate for proper fitment. Picture attached of the resulting print. Revised the design, and already uploaded updated files. The latest files should fit perfectly, with no sanding.

UPDATE 3: The grip extension near the mag well will interfere with the Nerf drum magazines. I have no intention of making any changes to accommodate that, but I thought it would be worth mentioning. I have only tried the 36 dart drum magazine, not the 18 dart one. 18 dart stick magazines work perfectly, of course.

I should note, for my big ole hands, this is very comfortable, if a little narrow.
