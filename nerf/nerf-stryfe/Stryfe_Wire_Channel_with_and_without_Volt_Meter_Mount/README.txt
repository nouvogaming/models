# Summary

This is an upgraded wire channel for the Nerf Stryfe.  It adds 5mm of space for wire so you can fit 16awg wire and volt meter wire.  There are 2 versions of this design, with Volt Meter mount and without, so you can use 16awg wire without having the volt meter mount in the way if you're rather go that route.  It was designed to take M2 *6mm screws and this voltage meter: http://foamblastshop.com/product/volt-meter/  Wire from voltage meter is long enough to reach the jam door switch.  Make sure you use the 3 pin switch from the stock loom and test which pins work for the application.  The 2 pin switches will not work.

This was designed for my printer and some of the holes might be too tight or loose depending on your printer's accuracy.  I have included the STEP file for both models so you can change them for personal use.
