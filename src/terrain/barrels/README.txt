This subdirectory contains models of terrain incorporating oil
drum-like barrels. Two complete models are available as of the
writing of this README (named barrels-1 and barrels-2).

It's worth noting that these models are first generated in OpenSCAD,
then imported into Blender for editing. Specifically I was having
trouble creating a nice transition along the edges of the base of
the model, so I hand-edited the models to fix this transition.

Final versions of the models, after post-processing with NetFabb,
are over on the products side.
