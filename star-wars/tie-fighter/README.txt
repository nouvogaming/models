This is a Tie Fighter model scaled for casual use in the X-Wing miniatures game, for example if you want to experiment with Tie swarm battles.

This model is a derivative of this Sketchup model:

It is apparently an original work of Katase:

The model had a number of internal structures that needed to be removed, and I eventually decided to replace the solar fins with my own, simpler design so I could better control thickness. And, of course, I added a connector to the bottom to accept a standard X-Wing base. The connector actually fits around the larger stem to help keep the model on the base.

The model is still not completely clean, but I found it would print well in Simplify3D at this point.

Note: The "angled" version of the model is simply to create a better Thingiverse image: you don't really need it.
