These were printed on a Replicator 2X at 0.2mm layers, 3 shells, and 15% infill.

I use paints that I have around for miniature painting to finish these. I've kept the number of paints
down in case someone wants to do this that doesn't already have dozens of bottles of paint around. I'm
sure you could find similar colors in cheap hobby paints also.

The painted tile was finished as follows: 
1. In a well-ventilated area (my balcony), inverted tile and dipped in liquid acetone for 10 seconds to
remove some of top surface artificial texture. 
2. After drying, washed with dish soap and dried. 
3. Spray primed with grey filler primer, further reducing printing artifacts. 
4. Base coated with 2:1 Escorpina Green : Leather Brown mix. 
5. Sponge painted with 2:1 Leather Brown : Escorpina Green mix. 
6. Sponge painted with 2:1 Livery Green : Leather Brown mix. 
7. Painted hill side with 3:3:1 Escorpina Green : Livery Green : Beastly Brown mix. 
8. Painted little trees/bushes in Livery Green. 
9. Krylon clear gloss. 
10. Army Painter anti shine spray to finish.
