Getting Happy Corners:

I *highly* suggest ears on corners of these models to prevent warping
of the model on the corners. I tend to print with either a glass
plate and Garnier Fructis #5 spray or on a BuildTak plate, and ~1cm
radius ears make a huge difference.

  Note: In this version, the cinderblocks were turned on and the whole
        model was mirrored across the x axis.
