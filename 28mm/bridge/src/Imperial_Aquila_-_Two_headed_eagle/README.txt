# Summary

<em>Imperial Aquila is a two-headed eagle sigil which represents the entirety of the Imperium of Man and was chosen by the Emperor of Mankind at the start of the Great Crusade in circa 800.M30.</em> - Warhammer 40K

There are low connecting bits that hold the wings, legs and heads attached to the torso. They are roughly half the height of the model and hide well, still keeping it sturdy.

# Print Settings

Notes: 
Infill is not necessary. I only used it so that the top layer would adhere more smoothly.

# Post-Printing

This is 0.1 layer, 0,4 nozzle, 1,2 shell, 1,0 top/bottom, 10% infill PLA and the model is scaled down to 15cm width. It printed nicely, but there were very small gaps in the tail feathers, as they were not optimal width.
