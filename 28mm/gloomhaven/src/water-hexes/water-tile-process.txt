here's what i tried the first time:

- mesh --> vertices --> remove doubles
- triangulate once or twice
- subdivide once or twice
bevel
  ctrl-b
  o 2
  s 4

triangulate corners
select edge, shift in.

note: this wasn't that satisfying. going to try drawing shapes in Inkscape and creating base in OpenSCAD, then importing and smoothing (because for some reason minkowski wasn't working?).

An idea on smoothing:
