max crack: 13 -- maybe even lower?
margin size: 0.5 -- maybe 0.4?

NOTE: something about how I generate meshes isn't quite right for Crack it!,
but if I select all the points (l), then partition into a new mesh (p), it
works (even if I do this on a single hex (?)). So rather than dive further
into what is wrong, I think this will be part of my workflow.
