# Summary

**UPDATE:** I uploaded two new files that are now solid, they no longer have the seem down the middle.

Bookcase for Gloomhaven. Occupies 2 hexes. Since obstacles do not block line of sight in the game I assumed they where below shoulder height for the human scoundrel.

Made from dutchmogul's awesome Delving Decor: Wizard's Shelf

# How I Designed This

The bookcase STL is just two cut up copies of the wizard shelf positioned next to each other.  Edited in Slic3r.  They are technically two pieces but are close enough they should merge when printing.  So, there will be a seem in the middle.
