# Summary

totem pole
one piece is the top by design
you decide which order to assemble the rest!
Stack it up, knock it down!
or glue it together.
added a flat top cut eagle as per request.


Modeled in sculptris and Treuspace 5

# Instructions

Took a long time slicing the file totemkit.stl

I am adding the individual elements separately.

Included the g-code and s3g files because it tool so long to slice.
These files are specific to the replicator with the accelerated setup
(Marlin) It pretty much fills the build plate.
my settings for the code and print were
0% infill
2 shells
.27 slice
230 degrees 80mm/sec

Also i did this
in skeinforge (50)
settings,
fill
Solid Surface Thickness (layers)
i have set to 5.
seems to help on the flat topped models (sometimes anyhow) 

for non replicator printers,
either resize and slice the totemkit.stl
(if you want all the pieces in one print) or use the seperate
stl files and size them the same for consistency ( or not if you just want a specific part)
I have added a cut up eagle to allow the wings to fit for a larger scaled print
( i had a comment that they wished they could print this as big as possible)

my print is very light for it's size (106 grams).
The fully assembled totem is over 41cm / 16 inches
I glued mine and put magnets on the base. it will stand without a base, but it is top heavy. some base mounting would be advisable if gluing.
