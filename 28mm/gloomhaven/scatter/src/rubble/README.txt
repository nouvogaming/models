# Summary

This miniature scatter terrain was designed for any tabletop RPG or wargame, or for [Discord (FKA Wayfarer Tactics)](http://www.illgottengames.net/products/second-edition-wayfarer-tactics), our fast, modular (as in "fully customizable") miniature gaming rules. If you want to check it out, it's [totally free here on our site, so give it a download!](http://www.illgottengames.net/products/second-edition-wayfarer-tactics). You can findthis and many similar pieces in our growing [Delving Decor collection](https://www.thingiverse.com/dutchmogul/collections/delving-decor/page:1).

We've set up a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/illgottengames) for anyone who's interested in helping to fund us so we can keep making free and open sourced games like Pocket-Tactics, Discord, and others, not to mention the growing catalog of gaming miniatures that you can use for whatever you want! (Psst... we take requests and commissions...)

The character model in the background is from [Reaper Miniatures](http://www.reapermini.com/). If you want to play around with these parts in TinkerCAD (to easily make your own rock formations) you can find it [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cJEXmMov1xn-rocky-rubble).

Enjoy!
