# Summary

These models were created with the generous support of my patrons on Patreon. You can join the fun at patreon.com/sablebadger to get advance access, free models, and support a quickly growing collection of tabletop models. Higher tiers can also participate in polling, and suggest future projects.

Playing around with some more terrain ideas for Fantasy settings and created some fountains for tabletop wargame settings.  The "water ripples" read well when printed, and painted and give it some life.  The water spouts were an experiment with starting in Tinkercad, and then editing them in MeshMixer to give it some natural texture.   They started out as sections of a torus I bundled together to approximate water, then I moved it to Meshmixer to smooth it out with the sculpting tools.  Still learning how to use the tools, but I think this will print better than my original idea.

Once I had the basic water fountain done, I remixed a couple of ways to give some variety.  Added skulls, for the EEEEVIL fountain look, and voila! it's a necromancer blood fountain or something.  Then I had to wreck it for the "ruins" look for a little Frostgrave terrain.

I also included a couple "Empty" variants by suggestion from one of my patrons for people to try their own water effects.
