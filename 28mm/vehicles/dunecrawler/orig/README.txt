# Summary

"I need your help! Please tell me about the dimensions of the real model so i can size and design it appropriately. Thx!"
___

This is a replica of the "Onager Dunecrawler" from the tabletop game  
Warhammer 40k.
You can use it for tabletop gaming or as simple decoration.  


_____  
The rights for the original Dunecrawler model belong to the creator of the Dunecrawler and/or Games Workshop, please support them ;)
_____  
What i have done so far:  

- Legs (√)  
- Platform for the cabin (√)  
- Cabin/Tower (in progress) 
  (change that stupid, idealess bearing thing on the weaponholder)  
- Dakka ( )  
- Details ( )  
- Little Skitarii gunner (maybe...)

# Instructions

I have printed it with layer resolution 0.1mm 
and a printing speed of 20mm per second (halved all default Cura[Version 2014] settings related to print speed)

My tip for the legs: lay it to the side in your slicer, cut it to halve by lowering it into the printbed and after printing glue it togehter.

I use good quality filaments for printing and acrylic miniature colours for painting.
